# Sunspots Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict monthly sunspot activity using historical data from 1749 to the present, sourced from the SIDC (Solar Influences Data Analysis Center) database. Three machine learning models were implemented: a Deep Neural Network (DNN), a combination of LSTM and CNN, and a hybrid model using DNN, LSTM, and CNN together. Each model was tuned for optimal performance, with the hybrid model achieving the best results.

## Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future sunspot activity based on historical data.
- **Multiple Models**: Compares three modelsâ€”DNN, LSTM+CNN, and a hybrid DNN+LSTM+CNN model.
- **Data Normalization**: All models use A Lambda layer to scale the input data.
- **Learning Rate Optimization**: Callbacks were used to monitor and optimize the learning rate during training.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Models
1. **DNN Model**:
